## Project Motivation:
To practice (visually) creating HTML forms and using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and other CSS techniques.

## What I Learned:
This project was meant to practice using CSS Grid and Flexbox (as well as creating an HTML form). One new technique I learned was the use of sprites to create icons.

Note: this form is not meant to submit and there is no corresponding backend, as I have not yet learned how to implement one.

## Further Improvements:
My CSS skills were a bit rusty at the time of this project, so it took a bit longer than I had anticipated. In the future, I will come back to this project and tidy the CSS up.
